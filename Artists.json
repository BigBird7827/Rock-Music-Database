      "Overview": "The Alan Parsons Project was a British studio-focused rock duo built around producer/engineer Alan Parsons and songwriter/pianist Eric Woolfson. Formed in London in 1975 after the pair met at Abbey Road Studios, the Project centered on concept-driven albums and a rotating cast of session singers and musicians.\n\nAcross eleven studio albums, they became a staple of late-70s/early-80s album rock, balancing progressive arrangements with radio-ready hooks. Their most widely recognized releases include I Robot (1977), The Turn of a Friendly Card (1980), and Eye in the Sky (1982).",

Their classic lineup—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—helped redefine popular music across the 1960s through rapid stylistic evolution, studio experimentation, and landmark songwriting.\n\nFrom early beat-driven hits to mid-era psychedelia and later studio craft, their catalog became a foundation for modern rock and pop. They disbanded in 1970, but their albums remain among the most celebrated and influential recordings in popular music.",
