            "FullText": "Alan Parsons (born 20 December 1948) is an English audio engineer, producer, and musician whose career is rooted in the classic Abbey Road studio tradition. He entered EMI/Abbey Road in the late 1960s and quickly became known for a calm, methodical approach to recording—skills that positioned him at the intersection of rock performance and high-end studio craft.\n\nBefore The Alan Parsons Project existed, Parsons had already built a reputation through major engineering work, including projects associated with The Beatles’ late-era sessions and other landmark recordings of the period. That early experience shaped his long-term priorities: clarity, balance, and a mix that rewards close listening without losing impact on radio or in large rooms.\n\nIn 1975, Parsons partnered with songwriter and pianist Eric Woolfson to launch The Alan Parsons Project. The concept was intentionally studio-first: Parsons would serve as engineer/producer and sonic architect, while Woolfson provided the bulk of the songwriting, lyrics, and direction. Because the “band” was essentially a production partnership, they recruited a rotating lineup of vocalists and session players selected song-by-song.\n\nAcross ten studio albums (1976–1987), Parsons’ production choices—layered textures, tight low-end, carefully staged vocals, and distinctive atmospheric transitions—helped the Project maintain a recognizable identity even as lead singers changed. After the Project era, Parsons continued releasing music and touring under his own name, presenting much of the Project catalog in live settings with the Alan Parsons Live Project."

            "FullText": "Eric Woolfson (18 March 1945 – 2 December 2009) was a Scottish songwriter, pianist, and vocalist who co-founded The Alan Parsons Project and supplied its central creative engine. Where Parsons brought elite engineering and production, Woolfson brought concept design, songwriting, and a knack for melodic hooks that could live comfortably inside ambitious, album-length themes.\n\nWoolfson’s role was unusually broad for a “band” context: he wrote the vast majority of the music, provided the lyrics, played keyboards on virtually every Project recording, and handled much of the organization and business management. He also sang lead on a number of the Project’s best-known tracks, giving the catalog a recurring vocal identity even though the Project regularly featured guest singers.\n\nThe Project’s studio-first model suited Woolfson’s strengths. He could build narratives and motifs across an album—then choose vocalists and players who fit each song’s emotional target. That approach helped The Alan Parsons Project maintain consistency across changing lineups, and it contributed to a run of albums that balanced progressive ambition with radio-ready craft.\n\nAfter the Project era concluded, Woolfson increasingly shifted toward musical theatre, developing stage works that incorporated or reinterpreted material associated with the Project’s catalog. He remained closely identified with the Project’s songwriting voice until his death in 2009."

      "Overview": "The Alan Parsons Project was a London-based studio partnership built around two complementary skill sets: Alan Parsons’ high-end engineering and production, and Eric Woolfson’s songwriting, keyboard work, and overall direction. Conceived in 1975, the Project treated the producer’s “house sound” as the unifying identity—a deliberate contrast to the era’s touring bands with fixed lineups.\n\nRather than tour, Parsons and Woolfson recorded with a rotating cast of trusted session musicians and vocalists, inviting specific voices to match each song. Across ten studio albums released between 1976 and 1987, they blended progressive rock textures with concise pop craft, yielding signature releases like I Robot and Eye in the Sky and enduring staples such as “Games People Play,” “Time,” and “Eye in the Sky.” The instrumental “Sirius,” opening Eye in the Sky, became a long-running arena-intro anthem, underscoring how the Project’s meticulous studio work translated into broad cultural staying power.",
